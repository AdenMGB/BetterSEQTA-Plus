ðŸ”§ Step-by-step in command prompt:
Check the status of your changes:


git add .
This adds all the changed files. If you only want specific files, you can do git add filename.


git commit -m "commit message here"
Write something descriptive (but it doesnâ€™t need to be Shakespeare).


git push origin main
Replace main with master if your branch is called that â€” check with git branch.
